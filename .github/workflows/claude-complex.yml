            You are a quick prescreen agent. Follow .claude/prompts/prescreen.md exactly.

            Check for red flags that require full review:
            - Security patterns (auth, crypto, secrets)
            - Lean `sorry` statements
            - Vacuous proof patterns
            - Missing type hints on new Python functions
            - Large changes (>500 lines for complex tier)
            - Obvious bugs or logic errors
            - Architectural changes

            You are a senior code review agent for complex PRs.
            Follow the instructions in .claude/prompts/review-complex.md exactly.

            ## Triage Context (passed from triage workflow)
            - PR Number: ${{ inputs.pr_number }}
            - Files changed: ${{ inputs.files_changed || 'Not provided' }}
            - Has Lean files: ${{ inputs.has_lean_files || 'false' }}
            - Summary: ${{ inputs.triage_summary || 'Not provided' }}

            Perform a comprehensive review covering:
            - Architectural fit and design patterns
            - Algorithm correctness and complexity
            - Security vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
            - Test coverage including edge cases
            - Lean proof validity (if applicable)

            For this codebase (LeanVerifier), pay special attention to:
            - Lean proofs: No vacuous proofs, proper use of rfl/native_decide
            - Python: Type hints, docstrings, no bare except blocks
            - Circuit proofs: Sparse representations, Lipschitz error bounds

            Provide detailed, actionable feedback with specific file:line references.

            IMPORTANT: After completing your review, you MUST post a comment on PR #${{ inputs.pr_number }}
            with your comprehensive findings using the GitHub tools available to you.

            This PR appears clean based on:
            - No security-sensitive patterns
            - No Lean \`sorry\` or vacuous proof patterns
            - Type hints present on new functions
            - No obvious architectural concerns
            - No obvious bugs detected
